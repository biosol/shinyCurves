Quantitative RT-PCR amplification has been the gold-standard tool for viral detection during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the desperate rush for a quick diagnosis led the use of very different types of machines and proprietary software, leading thus to an unbearable complexity of data analysis with a limited parameter setup. Here, we present shinyCurves, a shiny web application created to analyse multisource qPCR amplification data from independent multi-plate format. Furthermore, our automated system allows the classification of the results as well as the plot of both amplification and melting curves. Altogether, our web application is an automated qPCR analysis resource available to the research community.
